      This example is about connecting to your wallet using web3modal and creating
      a next.id Universal Profile where your linkedin handle is associated with your
      wallet address on chain.
      <br /><br />
      This example will also allow you to endorse a trust.id Universal Profile with
      the UTU Trust network (Web of Trust).
      <br /><br />
      Note that next.id is a decentralised ID aggregator while UTU Trust is web of trust.
      Combine both of these together and it gets sexy.
